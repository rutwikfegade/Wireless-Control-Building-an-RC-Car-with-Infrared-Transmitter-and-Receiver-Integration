# Wireless Control: Building an RC Car with Infrared Transmitter and Receiver Integration

On the car, a TSOP1738 IR receiver is used in connection with an Arduino.
The transmitter currently uses a standard television remote to send IR signals.
Four 60 rpm BO motors and one l298n motor driver are used in the car.
As of now, two 18650 lithium batteries are used in series for power.

## Key Components:

Infrared Receiver (TSOP1738): The TSOP1738 IR receiver is strategically employed to capture and interpret IR signals sent by the remote control. This enables seamless communication between the user and the Arduino-based car.

Arduino Microcontroller: The brains behind the operation, the Arduino microcontroller processes incoming signals from the IR receiver and translates them into commands for the car's movements and functions.

Infrared Transmitter (Television Remote): A standard television remote serves as the transmitter, allowing users to wirelessly control the car's actions. This user-friendly interface enhances the accessibility and versatility of the smart car.

DC Motors (Four 60 RPM BO Motors): The car is equipped with four high-torque 60 RPM BO motors, facilitating precise control and movement in various directions.

Motor Driver (L298N): The L298N motor driver acts as the powerhouse, controlling the speed and direction of the motors. Its robust design ensures efficient power management for smooth and dynamic car movements.

Power Source (Two 18650 Lithium Batteries in Series): The car relies on the energy provided by two 18650 lithium batteries connected in series. This configuration ensures a reliable and sustained power supply for extended operation.
